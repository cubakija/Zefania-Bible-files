Contains **zefania xml** format file of **Holy Bible New Serbian Translation (NST)**,  (Нови Српски Превод) (НСП).

NST is Bible of the Protestant canon (66 books) translated from the biblical languages by Miroslav Živković, MA, Aleksandar Birviš, PhD, and Žarko Đorđević. This is the first translation of the Old Testament from the original languages (because all previous translations were "translations of translations"), while there have been several translations of the New Testament from New Testament Greek in our language.
